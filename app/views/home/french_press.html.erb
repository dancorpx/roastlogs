        <h1>French Press</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <h5>Preparation</h5>
        <p>Boil fresh water in an electric or stove-top kettle. Set the temperature to 99ºC if possible.</p>
        <p>Seriously hot water is one of the most important elements of a great french press coffee, you want the water to be at a rolling boil before adding it immediately to the coffee.</p>
        <p>Measure out 19g of filter coffee and grind coarsely. The texture should be similar to flakes of rock salt. Add the ground coffee to your empty french press.</p>
        
        <h5>Brew</h5>
        <p>Quickly but carefully add 300g of boiling water to the french press.</p>
        <p>Stir the slurry gently so all grounds are completely saturated.</p>
        <p>Put the lid on top of the french press, but don’t plunge, and let it brew for 4 minutes.</p>
        
        <h5>Scoop and serve</h5>
        <p>After four minutes has passed, remove the lid and scoop the layer of brown foam and coffee grounds that are left on the surface of the french press.</p>
        <p>Replace the lid, plunge gently and pour immediately into cups or another vessel for serving. Do not serve direcly from the french press</p>
        
        <h5>Notes and cautions</h5>
        <p>If you cannot plunge the french press gently with two fingers, stop immediately. Some glass vessels can crack and break under high pressure. This is normally a sign that your grind is too fine and needs to be coarser.</p>
        <p>If you are after a stronger brew, try adding more coffee (say 22g instead of 19g) until you find a sweet spot that suits your tastes.</p>
        <p>For a more floral and ‘lighter’ brew, try shortening your brew time to 3:30 or 3:45.</p>
